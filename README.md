# Speech-Recognition-System
Speech-Recognition-System is a software developed in Python language, and it converts spoken utterances into text and vice versa. It has some more features like voice search and language translation.  I designed its GUI using python Tkinter and used several inbuild libraries such as Speech-Recognition library, Pyttsx, Pyaudio.
